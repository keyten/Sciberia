Если вы спросите случайного человека на улице о тестостероне, его ответ наверняка будет содержать комбинацию из трёх слов: "мужской половой гормон". Но ведь тестостерон также встречается у женщин, а его уровень у среднего человека варьируется на протяжении жизни. На самом деле тестостерон играет гораздо бо́льшую роль в повседневной жизни, а не только в том, что касается секса. Так что же такое тестостерон, и как он влияет на человека?

If you’d ask a random person on the street about testosterone, a combination of these three words may come up: “male sex hormone”. But testosterone also occurs in women, and varies in levels throughout the lifespan of the average human. In fact, testosterone has a much bigger role in daily life, not just when it comes to sex. So, what is testosterone, and how does it affect everyone?

When it comes to **testosterone in males**; levels rise after puberty and stabilize at age 20 and decrease after 40. Testosterone is a type of androgen (that’s a type of hormone) produced in the Leydig cells in the testes and its effects at puberty are stimulation of protein synthesis (increases growth and muscle mass), increase of metabolism, stimulation of long bone growth, stimulation of the formation red blood cells, increase of libido and other physical changes in puberty, such as the enlargement of the larynx and growth of the penis.

С увеличением возраста мужчины уменьшением уровня его тестостерона, могут начать проявляться симптомы дефицита тестостерона. Они включают в себя снижение либидо, эректильную дисфункцию, усталость, депрессию, нарушения сна

As men age and their testosterone levels decrease, symptoms of testosterone deficiency may begin to occur. They include reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, depression, sleep disturbance, decline in mental function, hot flashes and decreased vitality. More general physical changes that occur as a result of decreasing testosterone levels include loss of muscle mass, increase of body fat, hair loss, breast growth and loss of bone mineral density. Other, more serious symptoms can include metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and cardiac disease.  Diagnosis of testosterone deficiency is based on measuring total serum testosterone (below 300 ng/dl). Some diseases (like diabetes or COPD) and medications (like opioids, chemotherapy, or antiretroviral therapy) can also cause lower testosterone in men.

Testosterone therapy is when testosterone is used as a medication in order to address the symptoms of testosterone deficiency. When used this way, it can be can be given by intramuscular injections (a very common and economical method), by gels or patches, or through daily subcutaneous pellets – and it should always be monitored regularly by a doctor.  Benefits of testosterone therapy include improved energy, libido, muscle mass and mental functioning, and can help correct erectile dysfunction or depression caused by testosterone deficiency. It can also decrease the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Like any other drug, it should not be used if there are certain pre-existing health conditions to contend with, including male breast cancer, prostate cancer, likely prostate hypertrophy and severe sleep apnea.

Of course, testosterone plays a role in the life of **women** as well – during reproductive life, the ovary produces about 25% of testosterone in the body, and even during menopause 50% of women’s ovaries produce some testosterone. The adrenal gland produces the remainder of testosterone. Libido or sexual motivation in women is dependent on androgens like testosterone. Testosterone has been employed as part of a drug therapy that’s used to treat symptoms of menopause, and patients who received a combined estrogen/androgen drug after menopause reported higher levels of sexual desire and arousal, and a greater frequency of sexual fantasies.

Of course, this androgen also plays a large role in **hormone therapy for transgender patients**. In order to help medical professionals navigate this practice, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) and the Endocrine Society offer guidelines and protocols for treatment of transgender patients.

Cross hormone therapy for **transgender women** includes testosterone blockers (spironolactone or cypterone acetate) to bring levels down to below 55 ng/dl. This leads to a decrease in body hair, reduction in muscle mass, fat redistribution, change in sweat and odor patterns, as well as possible reversal of scalp hair loss. Sexual effects include reduction in erectile function, changes in libido, reduced sperm count and ejaculatory fluid and reduced testicular size.

Cross hormone therapy for **transgender men** consists of testosterone therapy. Target levels are generally cis- male levels (300-950 ng/dl). Testosterone therapy at any age leads typically to an increase in sex drive, sometimes vaginal dryness, clitoris growth (1-3 cm), increase in body hair, muscle mass and fat redistribution, acne and oily, thicker skin. Menstrual periods can stop, the voice can drops, and loss of facial hair and male pattern balding may occur. Most of these effects will happen within the first two years of testosterone therapy. Unfortunately, testosterone can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes, increase red blood cell count, and can cause headaches and enhance depression.

No matter who you are, testosterone will play a part in your life at some point, whether it’s beneficial or detrimental. Either way, if you find yourself wondering about your testosterone levels or recognizing symptoms of deficiency, consult your doctor!
